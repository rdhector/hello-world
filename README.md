# hello-world
My first serious effort to do GitHub
I am going to learn how to use GitHub before it's my New Year's resolution
My interests are Python, SAS, blockchain, statistics and bayesian analysis for healthcare services

This is the next step from 2018! I have been through two really tough years since I started this task
